## Cats MTL

Provides transformer typeclasses for cats' Monads, Applicatives and Functors.

You can have multiple cats-mtl transformer typeclasses in scope at once
without implicit ambiguity, unlike in pre-1.0.0 cats or Scalaz 7.

## Usage

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-mtl" % "1.3.0"
```

If your project uses ScalaJS, replace the double-`%` with a triple.  Note that **cats-mtl** has an upstream dependency on **cats-core** version 2.x.

Cross-builds are available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, 3.1.3, Scala Native, and ScalaJS major version 1.x.

If you're not sure where to start or what Cats MTL even is, please refer to the [getting started guide](https://typelevel.org/cats-mtl/getting-started.html).

### Supported Classes

- `EitherT`
- `Kleisli`
- `IorT`
- `OptionT`
- `ReaderWriterStateT`
- `StateT`
- `WriterT`

### Laws

The **cats-mtl-laws** artifact provides [Discipline-style](https://github.com/typelevel/discipline) laws for all of the type classes defined in cats-mtl. It is relatively easy to use these laws to test your own implementations of these typeclasses. Take a look [here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl/tree/main/laws/src/main/scala/cats/mtl/laws) for more.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-mtl-laws" % "1.3.0" % Test
```

These laws are compatible with both Specs2 and ScalaTest.

### Community

People are expected to follow the
[Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/) when
discussing cats-mtl on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If
you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or
that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and
